Given an array and a number K where K is smaller than the size of the array. Find the Kâ€™th smallest element in the given array. Given that all array elements are distinct.

Examples:  

Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, K = 3 
Output: 7

Input: arr[] = {7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15}, K = 4 
Output: 10
